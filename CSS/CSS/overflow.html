        <div id="overflowTest">First of all, I would've never looked back at you
          I would've never looked back at you
          If you didn't chase me, I would not be with you
          No, no, I would not be with you
          Now I'm not picking up when you call me
          No, I'm not gon' respond when you want me
          So better keep in mind that
          You were nothing other than a mindset
          Guess I should have known not to give all of me
          At the time, having my love was all you need
          And now you leave with all of my energy, not considering how I feel
          I'ma need that back from you, need that back from you, but
          It's not worth it, not worth it
          It's not worth it
          The way you make me feel, I'm hurting
          I'm hurting, see, I'm hurting
          So why did it take me this long
          To see that you're not worth my songs?
          But now I know it's not worth it
          Not worth it, it's not worth it.</div>
