<h2>display: inline</h2>
<div>Going round and round
I don’t wind that spring anymore
Close the orgel and clean everything
Feel like I'm an old toy
My scar that doesn’t get bigger
Rather be forgotten than hurt, wait (Hurt, wait)
Why am I afraid? Oh, why?
Got me feeling it, yeah. <span class="a">got</span> <span class="a">Feeling</span> Close the orgel and clean everything

<div>I don't care what you say
I burned my neverland
Run over the clock, turn over the scene
I don’t wanna stop
Yeah, we don't care what you say
I burned my neverland
I don’t look back after a long night
I have no regrets
I'll never come back. <span class="b">don't look back</span> <span class="b">no regrets</span>I burned my neverland

<h2>display: block</h2>
<div>Leave the hometown
Different, somehow
In the diary that stopped, fix it
A dream that disappeared behind a scared kid
Don’t close the eyes, now I can make it new
No more regrets
I'm tryna' play a fair game
Over my wallpaper, measure the height of the pain
Dreaded yesterday
Don't recall, it passed away
My fairytale won't be beautiful as starlight. <span class="c">fair game</span> <span class="c">scared kid</span>A dream that disappeared behind a scared kid
Don’t close the eyes, now I can make it new . </div>
